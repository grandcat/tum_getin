Idea of this folder is to provide files needed for global testing.

It will contain information about test users.
	-> General info: tum_id and token
	-> Current immatriculation status
	-> Public and private key

These users will be loaded into the database automatically
when starting the backend server with $ NODE_ENV=test grunt



Further Info:

- Password for all key files will be: tum-getin
