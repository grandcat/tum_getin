All backend server logs will be written into this directory.

There will be three different files (only one if everything is fine :) ):
- info.log	->	contains all logs (including error messages)
- errors.log	->	only contains error messages
- exceptions.log ->	contains uncaught exceptions (e.g. unexpected server crash)
