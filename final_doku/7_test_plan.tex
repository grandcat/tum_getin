\section{Test Plan}\label{sec:test_plan}

Due to the strict separation of the components \be, \ph and \ter testing could partly be initiated in early stages of the project.

Particularly the \be component was required to quickly reach a robust state because both other components heavily rely on its functioning.
In order to guarantee this robustness, development followed a test-driven approach from the beginning.
Functionality required in the \be was first defined in a specifications document.
Subsequently test cases based on these specifications were written using \vows as test suite.\todo{...}
Only then the actual implementation of the defined functionality began.
