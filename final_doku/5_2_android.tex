\subsubsection{Android architecture}
The Android app architecture consists of two activities. The $MainActivity$ is responsible for the registration process with the backend and the $UnlockProgressActivity$ provides a UI that shows the status of the NFC-communication.

Therefore, the three registration steps (send ID, activate token, finish registration) are represented as fragments.
