\section{Design Alternatives}
At the beginning, we thought about a robot (see figure \ref{img:robot1}) with two wheels (controlled by the two motors) in the front and a castor wheel in the back. The NUC and the Arduino sandwich are then put at the first level, at the barycenter of the wheels. The camera is placed at the top (second level).
