\section{Project Idea}

\subsection{Problem description}

Full-time students at TU MÃ¼nchen often face the problem that courses or seminars take place on a Saturday or a Sunday.
Since buildings at the university campus are generally closed at weekends, students have to ring for the security personnel to open the door. But due to the number of students entering and leaving university buildings, door wardens hardly ever check the legitimacy of any entrant's business, i.e.~if they really are students.\\
This situation is unsatisfactory for all participants.

\begin{itemize}
\item Students needlessly have to wait for someone to open the door.
\item Door wardens get distracted from more important work.
\item Door wardens and university authorities cannot guarantee that entering people are students (or authorised persons in general).
\end{itemize}
