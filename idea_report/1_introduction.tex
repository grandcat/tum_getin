\section{Introduction}

This paper serves as an idea report proposing a solution to control access to university buildings via a mobile device communicating with a receiver at the door. This communication shall work via near field communication (NFC). Main contribution of the proposed project will be an Android application embedded in a holistic system which provides simple door access capabilities.


The following chapter motivates the need for such a door access solution and sketches the project idea. Chapter \ref{sec:arch} then details the proposed technical architecture. Due to a several possible approaches, chapter \ref{sec:alt} justifies our design decisions. Finally, chapter \ref{sec:team} introduces all team members and chapter \ref{sec:plan} outlines a project plan.
