\section{Introduction}

Full-time students at TU MÃ¼nchen often face the problem that courses or seminars take place on a Saturday or a Sunday.
Since buildings at the university campus are generally closed at weekends, students have to ring for the security personnel to open the door. But due to the number of students entering and leaving university buildings, door wardens hardly ever check the legitimacy of any entrant's business, i.e.~if they really are students.
