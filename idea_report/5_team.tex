Made his bachelor in Mechatronics at the FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg. Right now, he is studying Automotive Software Engineering at TUM in the third out of four semester. He's excited about the combination of software and the interaction with physical problems, that also explains his previous education steps so far. Therefore he fits quite good into the project, cause it also will be a mixture of pure software problems and the physical frontend, in this case, opening the door.
